Target:
The upper end of the Chattahoochee River arm supports the greatest concentration of largemouth bass throughout the year.Anglers will find largemouths in close proximity to fallen trees or other types of structure most anytime.Finding structure at the right depth will be the key to catching largemouth bass on Lake Lanier. In the winter, largemouths will typically be in deeper water along creek channels or among the branches of fallen trees.During spring, bass will move into shallow water to spawn near tree stumps, rock outcroppings or other visible structure.Warm summer temperatures drive largemouth bass into deeper water in the 20-ft depth range along points and in the tops of standing timber.As fall approaches, largemouths will roam all types of habitats in search of shad and herring, so anglers need to use a run and gun approach to locate feeding fish.
